## What is this ?

This is kinda of a moodboard to convey a digital identity to my PIPS apps. While playing around with Bing AI image generator, I, after stumbling on many dead-ends, found that adding `, minimal soviet cartoon` or `socialist realist cartoon` to my search terms would yield the results that suited my taste the most. I then decided to make a theme out of it.

## Color Palette

**Socialist Realism** is a style of idealized realistic art that was developed in the Soviet Union and was the official style in that country between 1932 and 1988, as well as in other socialist countries after World War II. Socialist Realism is characterized by the depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. Socialist Realist paintings and sculptures used naturalistic idealization to portray workers and farmers as dauntless, purposeful, well-muscled, and youthful.

We have as a basis, derived from the flag of the Soviet Union, the following colors:

| Color | Hex Code | RGB Code    |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
|       | #F8C104  | (248,193,4) |
|       | #CC0404  | (204,4,4)   |
|       | #E15E04  | (225,94,4)  |
|       | #D43004  | (212,48,4)  |
|       | #CC2004  | (204,32,4)  |

Based on these characteristics, this could be a suitable color palette:

| Color  | Hex Code | RGB Code      |
| ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| Red    | #FF0000  | (255,0,0)     |
| Yellow | #FFFF00  | (255,255,0)   |
| Black  | #000000  | (0,0,0)       |
| White  | #FFFFFF  | (255,255,255) |
| Gray   | #808080  | (128,128,128) |

Red and yellow symbolize the revolution and socialism. Black and white are often used for contrast and realism. Gray can represent the industrial and urban aspects of Soviet society.
