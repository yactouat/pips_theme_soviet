## What is this ?

This is kinda of a moodboard to convey a digital identity to my PIPS apps. While playing around with Bing AI image generator, I, after stumbling on many dead-ends, found that adding `, minimal soviet cartoon` or `socialist realist cartoon` to my search terms would yield the results that suited my taste the most. I then decided to make a theme out of it.

## Images

You'll find the images in the `images` folder. They can be re-used across my apps to convey a consistent identity. They are available via GitHub's CDN.
